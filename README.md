This is a fork of the [FluxJpeg.Core](https://github.com/briandonahue/FluxJpeg.Core) library

FluxJpeg.Core is a clone of the original [Google Code library](https://code.google.com/p/fjcore) that currently seems to be stagant.

## Fork

This fork was created to fix two issues with the original library

* Density properties can be updated but are never encoded in the Jpeg encoder
* No support for hierarchical JPEG files

## Pull request

These fixed have been merged into the [FluxJpeg.Core](https://github.com/briandonahue/FluxJpeg.Core) library.
