FJCore: A Fluxcapacity Open Source Project
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for checking out FJCore, an image library including a pure C# implementation
of the JPEG baseline and progressive codecs.

Design goals:
 - No external dependencies (besides a C# compiler and ECMA-standard CIL runtime)
 - High performance
 - High image quality
 - Simple, intuitive usage pattern

With your help, we can make this one of the most readable and efficient libraries
available to run on any CIL runtime (including the .NET framework, Mono, and Silverlight)!
